      <description>The Outer Limits is an anthology series of distinct story episodes, sometimes with a plot twist at the end. Unlike the original incarnation of the series, which was a pure anthology with each episode completely unrelated to the others, the revival series maintained an anthology format, but occasionally featured recurring story elements that were often tied together during season-finale clip shows. The Outer Limits is an American science horror anthology tv-series that was first aired in 1995. See the best episodes of The Outer Limits below.</description>

      <description>The Three Stooges were an American vaudeville and comedy team active from 1922 until 1970, best known for their 190 short subject films by Columbia Pictures that have been regularly airing on television since 1958. Their hallmark was physical farce and slapstick. In films, the stooges were commonly known by their actual first names. There were a total of six stooges over the act&amp;rsquo;s run (with only three active at any given time), but Moe Howard and Larry Fine were the mainstays throughout the ensemble&amp;rsquo;s nearly fifty-year run. The Three Stooges are American short subject films that ran from 1934 to 1959. See the best episodes of The Three Stooges below.</description>

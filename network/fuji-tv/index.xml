      <description>Years ago, the fearsome pirate king Gol D. Roger was executed, leaving a huge pile of treasure and the famous &amp;lsquo;One Piece&amp;rsquo; behind. Whoever claims the &amp;lsquo;One Piece&amp;rsquo; will be named the new pirate king. Monkey D. Luffy, a boy who consumed one of the &amp;lsquo;Devil&amp;rsquo;s Fruits&amp;rsquo;, has it in his head that he&amp;rsquo;ll follow in the footsteps of his idol, the pirate Shanks, and find the One Piece. It helps, of course, that his body has the properties of rubber and he&amp;rsquo;s surrounded by a bevy of skilled fighters and thieves to help him along the way. Monkey D. Luffy brings a bunch of his crew followed by, Roronoa Zoro, Nami, Usopp, Sanji, Tony-Tony Chopper, Nico Robin, Franky, and Brook. They will do anything to get the One Piece and become King of the Pirates! One Piece is a Japanese action and adventure anime that was first aired in 1999.

      <description>The Outer Limits is an anthology series of distinct story episodes, sometimes with a plot twist at the end. Unlike the original incarnation of the series, which was a pure anthology with each episode completely unrelated to the others, the revival series maintained an anthology format, but occasionally featured recurring story elements that were often tied together during season-finale clip shows. The Outer Limits is an American science horror anthology tv-series that was first aired in 1995. See the best episodes of The Outer Limits below.</description>

      <description>Chicagoan Frank Gallagher is the proud single dad of six smart, industrious, independent kids, who without him would be&amp;hellip; perhaps better off. When Frank&amp;rsquo;s not at the bar spending what little money they have, he&amp;rsquo;s passed out on the floor. But the kids have found ways to grow up in spite of him. They may not be like any family you know, but they make no apologies for being exactly who they are. See the best Shameless episodes below.</description>

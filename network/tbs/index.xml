      <description>The series focuses on an eccentric motley crew that is the Smith family and their three housemates: Father, husband, and breadwinner Stan Smith; his better half housewife, Francine Smith; their college-aged daughter, Hayley Smith; and their high-school-aged son, Steve Smith. Outside of the Smith family, there are three additional main characters, including Hayley&amp;rsquo;s boyfriend turned husband, Jeff Fischer; the family&amp;rsquo;s man-in-a-goldfish-body pet, Klaus; and most notably the family&amp;rsquo;s zany alien, Roger, who is full of masquerades, brazenness, and shocking antics.

The shinigami in charge of Karakura town, Kuramadani Zennosuke interrupts their conversation, yelling at them to stop doing his job. The next day, Rukia is instructed a mission by Ukitake to prevent Ichigo from fighting because of the fast rate of his disappearing spiritual powers. That night, Ishida and Rukia save Ichigo from a hollow and tell him to rest, much to his dismay. The next day, Ichigo takes Rukia and his friends to an ice skating rink, since he saw Rukia staring at the place a lot. Fireworks from a nearby amusement park begin to shoot up in the sky, ending the day on a happy note. While walking home, Ichigo senses a giant hollow and goes to his shinigami form, before being stopped by Rukia. Ichigo once again struggles against the giant hollow as his powers begin to fail him. Rukia saves him, leaving Ichigo to question if he was getting in her way. Rukia replies with a heartwarming speech about their friendship. Ichigo requests for Rukia to freeze the hollows legs, and he fires his &#34;last getsuga tenshou,&#34; destroying the hollow. Ichigo, exhausted, has a brief conversation with Rukia before he is told to rest. Ichigo wakes up in his human body, in his room, with his friends surrounding him. Ichigo takes note of his disappearing powers, and asks to go outside. Outside, Ichigo notices that he can barely sense spirits anymore and even Rukia&#39;s presence is disappearing. The two say goodbye and have a brief conversation before Rukia begins to disappear from Ichigo&#39;s sight. After Rukia fully disappears, Ichigo thanks her.</p><div class="episode-ott">

Urahara tells him that there are several ways to escape the restrictive current but none to escape the cleaner so it is unknown how Ichigo escaped. Elsewhere, Mayuri uses his zanpakuto to drug Inaba. Inaba then summons fake Isane and attacks her. At Urahara shop, Rukia then explains Project Spearhead to the rest of the group in which mod souls were used. Inaba then takes the soul candy from the Reigai and swallows it, resulting with Inaba being rejected from his body and the Reigai taking the effects of the drug. Inaba then ressurects most of the defeated Reigai, unleashing their true strength and revealing his backstory as the one who created mod souls. The episode ends with Nozomi admitting she was the first mod soul.</p>

The Fake Kyoraku and Ukitake are unable to defeat the head captain, who criticizes their claim that they retain their pride. Fake Unohana arrives and heals their wounds, revealing their strategy to exhaust the head captain. Elsewhere in Seireitei, Byakuya is stopped by the Fake Hitsugaya, and the two unleash their bankais in a brief battle. Byakuya asks the imposter why someone would fight for Inaba, and Fake Histugaya claims that he want to protect some one, whom the original also want to protect but the original one does not have the power to do it,which he has. Byakuya criticizes his motives and eventually manages to defeat him, though narrowly escaping Hitsugaya&#39;s Hyoten Hyakasso. Back in the living world, Ichigo asks Urahara to send him to Soul Society. He is advised not to go due to his declining spirit energy. However, Nozomi steps up and reveals a type of healing kido that restores some of Ichigo&#39;s lost spiritual power. He then proceeds with heading to Soul Society, where Inaba meets with Nozomi&#39;s unconscious soul claiming she will return.</p>

Although he does not give the reason, Muramasa replies that zanpakut≈çs can seperate themselves away regardless of being the soul of a shinigami, and he is a good example of one. Ichigo cannot accept this view and attacks him. Muramasa uses illusions to overwhelm Ichigo and pins him to the ground, where he proceeds to drag Zangetsu out of him. Once Zangetsu manifests, he immediately attacks Ichigo. Meanwhile, Mayuri begins experimenting on himself in order to research the zanpakut≈çs&#39; manifestation. After Zangetsu seemingly defeats Ichigo, Ichigo transforms into his hollow form and strikes back. After a while, he transforms into his stronger form and easily beats down Zangetsu. Muramasa tries a sneak attack but Ichigo immediately regenerates and attacks him. Before the hollow form can do anything else, Ichigo manages to return to his shinigami form and falls unconscious at Muramasa&#39;s feet.</p>

Wonderweiss then blows of the smoke remaining after Soifon&#39;s bankai missile out of Barragan making him resume his place. Just when all the Shinigami&#39;s begin to panic, the Vizards make an unsuspecting arrival right in front of Aizen, Gin and Tosen.

                </div><p class="episode-quote">Hisagi is wounded in a surprise attack by Kazeshini, but Izuru intervenes to help him, and using kido, binds Kazehini long enough for the two of them to escape. Renji&#39;s fight with Zabimaru continues, and Zabimaru takes the advantage when they are able to activate bankai while Renji, no longer able to control them, cannot. Renji considers his own weaknesses, and tricks Zabimaru into taking his sword, then breaks it with a Red Flame Cannon kido spell and uses Higa Zekkou to defeat Zabimaru by firing the broken shards at them. Ichigo fights Zangetsu, and struggles when Zangetsu activates Bankai. He uses a new Getsuga Tenshou working together with his inner hollow to defeat Zangetsu, and forces Muramasa to retreat. Zangetsu reveals that Muramasa is using a technique to awaken the zanpakutos&#39; instincts and by doing so, he can control them.</p>

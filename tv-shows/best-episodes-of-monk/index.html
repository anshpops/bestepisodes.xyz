But after the tragic (and still unsolved) murder of his wife Trudy, he developed an extreme case of obsessive-compulsive disorder. Now working as a private consultant, Monk continues to investigate cases in the most unconventional ways. See best Monk episodes below.</p>

After visiting the home of Daniel Carlyle, a musician who fits this description, Monk concludes that Daniel&#39;s mother and her other son, Jason, killed Daniel and that Jason is masquerading as his brother. Meanwhile, little Tommy is temporarily removed from the custody of his foster parents, and Monk surprises everyone, including himself, by volunteering to care for him for two weeks until his new adoptive parents can take him.

But Inspector No. 8, the only shirt inspector who can meet Monk&#39;s criteria for perfection, is not up to her usual standards. Sensing that something is wrong, Monk visits No. 8 on the job. The inspector, Maria Ortiz, informs him that her son, Pablo, has been imprisoned for murdering a fashion model, but she&#39;s certain that he&#39;s innnocent. Monk is chiefly concerned about his shirts, but Natalie persuades him to talk to Pablo because &#34;it&#39;s the right thing to do.&#34; The conversation uncovers just one clue: Pablo can&#39;t read English. When Monk realizes that the killer must have been able to read an emergency exit sign, he&#39;s convinced that Pablo is innocent despite the DNA evidence used to convict him. With Stottlemeyer and Disher in tow, Monk and Natalie attempt to talk to the model&#39;s former roommate and the fashion designer she worked for, Julian Hodge. But now there&#39;s a new problem: Hodge wants thirteen-year-old Julie to model for him. Watching the rehearsal for a fashion show in which Julie will make her debut, Monk discovers a clue that points him to the real killer. When another supermodel is found dead, it&#39;s imperative that Monk find new evidence to prove his suspect guilty of both murders and set Pablo free – and for Natalie to get Julie away from the person committing the murders.</p>

Neither Monk nor Stottlemeyer wants to work with Christie, whom they hold responsible for some missing cocaine and the death of two police officers, and both of them disregard the evidence that Edna might have been murdered – a broken shoe heel (suggesting that the victim ran from someone or something), her dust allergy (which normally kept her from entering the loading dock where the death occurred), and the three letters (in different handwriting but with similar stamps) complaining about the victim. Twenty-seven days later, realizing that the stamps were all from the same roll and therefore from the same person, Monk reluctantly agrees to help Christie discover a suspect and a motive by working undercover as a store clerk.

After several frightening and mysterious encounters with a blood-soaked man that no one else can see, she begins to doubt her own sanity, and Stottlemeyer advises Monk to give her time off to restore her nerves. Monk is left with an irritating substitute nurse whose philosophy is the opposite of Sharona&#39;s: everything from Monk&#39;s requests for wipes to the obsessively systematic organization of his refrigerator has to go. Wanting Sharona back again, Monk goes to the garage where Sharona first saw the blood-soaked man and finds a clue--the silver tip from the toe of a cowboy boot. Meanwhile Sharona, who is attending a night class in creative writing, apparently forgets to turn in an assignment and seems to be misplacing objects. But when her writing instructor&#39;s husband dies of a heart attack after eating tomato soup, Sharona recognizes the plot of her missing story and realizes that she&#39;s not crazy.

Examining Natalie&#39;s apartment, Monk finds a single clue, an unused fish net caught between the sofa cushions, suggesting that the intruders were trying to steal Mr. Henry, Julie&#39;s pet fish. But why would anyone want to steal a ninety-nine-cent red herring, er, crimson marblefish?

He soon deduces from the absence of skid marks and other clues that the young man in the overturned Volkswagen that caused the pile-up was murdered and his body placed in the car to make his death look like an accident. But the highway patrolman in charge of the &#34;accident&#34; scene wants nothing to do with Monk (or the not-very-successful lawyer who has latched onto him), and the mountains blocking the signal prevent Monk from calling Captain Stottlemeyer for an authorization to investigate. Monk briefly returns to Natalie&#39;s car, where he finds Julie in need of a bathroom and Natalie nursing an injured wrist. Unfortunately for them, Monk&#39;s mind is on the fatality, and he returns to the Volkswagen. The angry officer gives him the victim&#39;s name and occupation (environmental activist), but he still refuses to listen to Monk&#39;s evidence. Meanwhile, t...</p>

The three ask Fairy Tail for their help in determining the source of a magical anomaly similar to Zeref&#39;s magic that they have sensed around the Grand Magic Games arena Domus Flau. In exchange, Ultear uses her magic to double their magic power. As the others undergo the painful &#34;power-up&#34; process, Erza talks with Jellal over his regained memories. The two nearly kiss, but Jellal decides he and Erza cannot be together and lies to her that he has a fiancée. Erza quickly picks up on this and respects his decision, seeing Crime Sorciere off as they leave.</p>

The eight participants - Natsu, Gray, Juvia, Elfman, Cana, Freed, Levy, and Mest (a man who claims to be Mystogan&#39;s disciple) - are instructed to choose a partner to accompany them during the exam, which is to take place on Tenrou Island, Fairy Tail&#39;s holy ground. Natsu partners with Happy, Gray with Loke (who temporarily nullifies his contract with Lucy to do so), Juvia with Lisanna, Elfman with Evergreen, Freed with Bickslow, Levy with Gajeel, and Mest with Wendy. During this time, Cana tells Lucy that she intends to leave the guild should she fail the exam, stating that she has failed the exam four times before. She reveals her reasons for doing so to Lucy, who offers to become Cana&#39;s partner. Meanwhile, Charle has brief glimpses of disastrous events in the future, one of which includes the black-haired youth from the forest.</p>

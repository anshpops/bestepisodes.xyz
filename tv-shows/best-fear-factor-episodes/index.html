These stunts are designed to challenge the contestants both physically and mentally. If a player is too afraid to complete or fail a stunt, the player is eliminated. If they succeed, they are one step closer to the grand prize: $50,000. See the best episodes of Fear Factor below.</p>

Stunt #1 (Helicopter platform transfer) Both team members would have to leap back and forth between two platforms hanging from helicopters, each person transferring up to 10 flags from one platform to the other and then jumping in the water below. The three teams get highest flag total would advance to the next round. The team with the least flags would be eliminated. Stunt #2 (Fear Factor Barber Shop) One team member would be seated in a barber chair and their partner would spin them. When the chair stopped, they would have to get whichever haircut their head was pointing to. The options were Mohawk, bald spot, patches, the taco, sideways Mohawk, and bald. Teams would advance to the finals if both members got their designated haircuts. Stunt #3 (Exploding container) As a crane lifted a large container to 200 feet in the air, both team members would have to climb rope ladders hanging from the container. Once they reached the container, they would both have to scale a narrow ledge on the side, collect two Allen wrenches, and climb another ladder to the top. Once on top, they would have to use the wrenches to unscrew hatches and climb down into the container. When they were both inside, they would have to touch two pieces of a livewire together in order to blow themselves out of the container and into the water below. The team to complete this stunt the fastest would be the Fear Factor Champions. Home Invasion Stunt (Stink beetle transfer) Competing in this weekâ€™s Home Invasion would be the Kutz family of Memphis, Tennessee. Two family members would have to take turns using their mouths to transfer stink beetles from one bowl to another. If they could transfer all the stink beetles in one minute, they would win a $5,000 Capital One Credit Card.</p><div class="episode-person-1">

The men would have to run across a swamp and retrieve a key from a pit of scorpions, then run back across the swamp and use the key to unlock the first lock.

Stunt #3 (Psycho Shower Rescue) The women would be handcuffed to the showerhead in one of the Bates Motel rooms as blood rained down on them. Outside, the men would have to unscrew an axe from the bottom of an ice chest filled with disgusting slop and use the axe to chop down the door to the room. They would then have to find a key which would be hidden in a vase, a potted plant, a lamp, or a nightstand. Once they had had the key, they would have to chop down the bathroom door and use the key to free their partner from the handcuffs. The couple to complete this stunt fastest would have two options: They could accept a pair of customized bikes from Metropolitan Choppers or be exempt from the next stunt. They would have to give the prize they didnâ€™t choose to another couple. No one would be eliminated in this stunt. Stunt #4 (Street luge flag snag) The men would be lying on a sled being pulled behind a hearse as a semi truck followed behind.

The men would then have to reach up and grab a flag on a pole jutting from the front of the truck. Once they had the flag, the women would have to tow them back in, take the flag, climb over the hearse, and clip the flag to a flagpole on the hood. The couple with the slowest time would be eliminated.

Stunt #1 (Helicopter box jump) Both twins would be hanging from the skits of a helicopter over a lake. As the helicopter flew over an island of boxes, the first twin would let go and try to land on the boxes. The helicopter would then fly over a second island of boxes and the second twin would have to try and drop on that box island. They both would have to collect a flag from their box island, jump in the water, swim to a platform, and clip the flag to a flagpole. If they missed the boxes, they would have to swim in the opposite direction to a penalty buoy to get the flag. The time would stop when the second person clipped their flag. The three sets of twins to complete this stunt the fastest would advance to the next round. The slowest team would be eliminated. Stunt #2 (Save Your Twin in Bees) One twin would be chained by both arms and legs to two poles and covered with bees. The other twin would have to search t</p><div class="episode-person-1">

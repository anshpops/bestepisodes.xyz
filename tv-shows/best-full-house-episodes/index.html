Everyone is relieved when a doctor tells them that Michelle is out of Danger, but Michelle did take a hard hit on the head, so the doctor has decided to keep Michelle in the hospital overnight for observation. The doctor takes Danny, Jesse, and Joey to the room Michelle is in, and Michelle doesn&#39;t know who they are. The doctor explains that memory loss is common with head injuries, and it&#39;s usually temporary.

Main Synopsis: Joey is the host of the test pilot episode of a game show called &#34;The Perfect Couple&#34;, a show that would remind you of the Newlywed Game. The three couples on the game are a dating couple (D.J. and Steve), an engaged couple (Danny and Vicky), and a married couple (Jesse and Becky). While everyone is out, doing the new show, Stephanie and Michelle have their work cut out for them as they babysit Nicky and Alex. Vicky is out of town, so she can&#39;t be on the show with Danny, and Estelle, the woman who substitutes for Vicky, seems to know Danny all too well, and as a result of the show, D.J. thinks she and Steve don&#39;t know each other well enough. When Vicky shows up at the studio that &#34;The Perfect Couple&#34; was taped in, she tells Danny that her lifelong dream of being a network news anchor has come true -- she has accepted a job as a network news anchor in New York City. Danny is more than a little disappointed -- he wa</p>

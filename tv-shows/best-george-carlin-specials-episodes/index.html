Unlike the first two, this special was edited down to an hour and routines from the same show like &#34;A Place for My Stuff&#34; and &#34;Baseball and Football&#34; do not appear in this special in contradiction to many internet descriptions. The final performance of &#34;Seven Dirty Words,&#34; his last recorded performance of the routine, features Carlin&#39;s updated list.</p>

In the HBO airing there is a short skit before and after the show in which he flees from three men seeking an envelope in his possession before going on stage. The identities of his pursuers are unknown: the credits before the skit merely dubs them &#34;The Bad Guys.&#34; Carlin tears the envelope up after the performance, never revealing its contents or why his pursuers wanted it. It could be speculated that the entire skit was relevant to the title of the album. That is to say that it was only designed to play with the audience&#39;s head and didn&#39;t actually have to do with the concert at all. At the end of the closing credits, the envelope is seen back on the table.</p>

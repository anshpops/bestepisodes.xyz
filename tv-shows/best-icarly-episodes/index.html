The NCC forces them to pay $500,000 dollars or they will shut down iCarly, so Jimmy blogs asking America for their spare change to help the iCarly gang get the money.</p><div class="episode-ott">

Carly and Sam soon realize there is more than that - they even spoofed Messing with Lewbert. So, Spencer and the iCarly team go to Hollywood to settle this, and to look for the frozen head of the founder, staying in a low-quality hotel where somebody was killed next to a window with a hobo named Hollywood. Visiting Dingo Studios, Carly and Sam learn the &#34;Totally Teri&#34; writers are plagiarizing iCarly skits for their own use, and they claim they have rights to do so, since they have money and power. Meanwhile, Spencer and Freddie find Charles Dingo&#39;s (the founder of Dingo studios) head and come up with a plan (along with Sam and Carly), since they have access to the head. The next day, the iCarly group threatens to release depictions of Dingo&#39;s head on iCarly.com unless the writers swear never to steal the show&#39;s ideas again; Afterwards, two of the writers end up on iCarly in a skit called &#34;Bikini Dog Food Fight&#34;.</p>

At first, he builds one that blinds intruders, but takes it apart after it blinds Carly. He then makes one that shoots corn at intruders, but it malfunctions and attacks Carly, Freddie and Spencer. They try to have it focus on Mrs. Benson and unplug it, but Spencer doesn&#39;t manage to pull the plug out of the outlet before the machine runs out of corn, so Mrs. Benson is heavily pelted with corn. Meanwhile, Sam and Gibby open a secret restaurant named Gibby&#39;s in the basement at school. Bully Billy Boots, who just got out of juvie, harasses and irritates Gibby. Sam tries to diffuse the situation by sending Gibby to go on a walk and trying to talk to Billy, but when Gibby returns later, Billy attacks him and Sam beats up Billy with a Butter sock. The next day, Billy tells Mr. Howard about the restaurant and hopes it gets shut down. Even though Principal Franklin, one of Gibby&#39;s customers himself, agrees that the restaurant violates school rules, he allows Sam and Gibby to keep running it in secret as soon as Mr. Howard is out of earshot.</p>

Missy&#39;s actions are claimed &#34;accidental&#34;, however Sam realizes what Missy is trying to do, but no one believes her as they think Sam is being &#34;her usual paranoid self&#34;, because she was being paranoid when she thought Lewbert was an undercover cop, because she thought his giant wart was a spy cam and thought Gibby was a mermaid because he doesn&#39;t like wearing shirts. Missy confesses to Sam, but since no one will believe her, she is forced to ask Freddie for help, so when Freddie wins a six month cruise, he gives it to Missy so she will go away. Shortly after Missy is awarded with the cruise, Carly discovers Missy&#39;s plans to destroy her and Sam&#39;s friendship. Meanwhile, while packing for a camping trip, Spencer is locked in the basement by a psychotic boy, Chuck, seeking revenge from Spencer for telling on him and getting him grounded in the episode &#34;iHurt Lewbert&#34;. Chuck is eventually caught at the end of the episode and is grounded by his father.</p>

Ako distracts Keita by taking him to a cosplay shop whilst Riko investigates the 18&#43; section of a game shop. Whilst changing, they run into Ako&#39;s teacher, Yūzuki, who is a closet otaku (dressed as Mahoro from Mahoromatic Maiden). Riko later encounters her whilst trying to get a special edition game. After meeting Keita and being reminded about Ako and Riko&#39;s crush on him, Yūzuki drags him off to talk to him, inadvertently taking him to a cosplay-themed love hotel. After later being found by Ako and Riko, the group are encountered by Keita&#39;s kōhai and Yūzuki&#39;s younger sister Mikazuki, who covers for Yūzuki by stating she was buying the game for her. Mikazuki is an otaku as well—she gets Yūzuki to cosplay as Mai Shiranui for her that night.</p>

But a few incidents involving paraders enables Ako and Riko to indeed spend some time with Keita alone. They also had to contend with Kiryu-sensei (who was patrolling the fair and catches Riko and Keita in the forest), Mikazuki, who is Miss Mikoshi, and a (ahem, naughty) chick that Ako bought that caused Keita to see Miharu peeing in the bushes. Shocked, Miharu drops on the ground what seems to be a love letter.</p>

Ako&#39;s hope backfires and ends up getting Keita&#39;s shirt collar, Mikazuki wins the opportunity for Keita to flip her skirt, though he is unaware she wasn&#39;t wearing any underwear. Riko wins a chance to kiss Keita in front of everyone, but is too embarrassed to do it. Miharu gets the remaining prize, to spend ten minutes in the equipment room alone with Keita to do anything. Keita simply uses the time to thank Miharu, but after a slip up, they end up in a compromising position, leading Ako and Riko to assume the worst. Later that night whilst Keita goes to sleep, Ako and Riko make a move on him, though this just gives Keita weird dreams. As he subconsciously grabs his jacket, a button he had been saving for them falls out, and they decide to stop. As the new semester starts, Keita walks hand in hand with Ako and Riko to high school together.</p>

Ako shows Keita her chest in order to encourage him to study, but this ends up being all Keita can think about in class. Ako decides to try an alternative method, writing the notes on her body. Despite embarrassing himself in school whilst distracted, he fares better on the tests. However, when Keita likens a kiss from Ako as a penalty game, Ako gets mad and corners him, eventually making him do a wrong answer so he would have to take the penalty game. They hint at going further, but are stopped by Riko, who had been learning how to prepare food for Keita, though it ends up tasting bad. Despite this, Keita manages to improve his grade.</p>

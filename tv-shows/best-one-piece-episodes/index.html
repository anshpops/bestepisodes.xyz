        <p class="show-quote">Years ago, the fearsome pirate king Gol D. Roger was executed, leaving a huge pile of treasure and the famous &#39;One Piece&#39; behind. Whoever claims the &#39;One Piece&#39; will be named the new pirate king. Monkey D. Luffy, a boy who consumed one of the &#39;Devil&#39;s Fruits&#39;, has it in his head that he&#39;ll follow in the footsteps of his idol, the pirate Shanks, and find the One Piece. It helps, of course, that his body has the properties of rubber and he&#39;s surrounded by a bevy of skilled fighters and thieves to help him along the way. Monkey D. Luffy brings a bunch of his crew followed by, Roronoa Zoro, Nami, Usopp, Sanji, Tony-Tony Chopper, Nico Robin, Franky, and Brook. They will do anything to get the One Piece and become King of the Pirates! One Piece is a Japanese action and adventure anime that was first aired in 1999.

Kuma&#39;s motivations become questionable when he vanishes the Pacifista, gives Rayleigh some secret information, and refuses to explain himself to Kizaru. He then goes after each of the Straw Hats, vanishing them one-by-one before Luffy&#39;s helpless eyes. Brook falls trying to protect Usopp and Sanji, Usopp falls as he tries to get away, Sanji falls when he attacks in retaliation, Franky falls when he tries to get past Kuma, Nami falls as she pleads to Luffy for help, Chopper falls as he continues his mindless rampage, and Robin falls as she tries to flee. Luffy breaks down sobbing at the realization that he&#39;s alone and he failed his crew, as Kuma tells him that they will never meet again before vanishing him too. The Straw Hat Pirates have been completely annihilated.</p>

She tries to board the evacuation ship, but per Spandaine&#39;s orders, she is denied access. Vize-Admiral Kuzan, later known as Admiral Aokiji, enters the scene to engage in battle with Saulo. While they fight, the evacuation ship is sunk by the fanatical Vice-Admiral Sakazuki, later known as Admiral Akainu. Saulo, on the verge of dying, instructs Robin to flee on his raft. Persuaded by Saulo&#39;s argument and Sakazuki&#39;s action, Kuzan helps Robin escape. From then on, Robin lives a life on the run, not being able to trust even the kindest of people, in a world that believes that her existence alone is a sin. In the present, Robin admits her greatest fear: to be seen as a burden by her crewmates and cast away, because being with her means having the world as their enemy. Finally knowing what kept her away, Sogeking, on Luffy&#39;s order, burns the government&#39;s flag, declaring war.</p>

At that point, Sanji&#39;s group is attacked by what appears to be a singing ship, which belongs to the Yonko Big Mom. On the ship are Tamago and Pekoms, who reveal that their goal is Caesar Clown.

Law switches Nami , Franky and Chopper&#39;s bodies again. Nami ends up in Sanji&#39;s body because Sanji is far away with Zoro and Brook . Law tells them that they can&#39;t go back once things start moving for example capturing Caesar Clown who has the Logia type Gasu Gasu no Mi. He warns them that he is highly dangerous therefore, they need Haki users to beat him. Luffy says that the Haki users there are him, Law, Zoro and Sanji. The marines are continuing their fight against Caesar&#39;s men. The three centaurs open the door and see a big glop of Slime that seeps out poison gas, most of them die and two survive so they run as it chases them. Caesar calls the pet slime monster Smiley and says that the Straw Hats and the G-5 marines are being used as test subjects for it.</p>

The Straw Hat Pirates have a meeting via Den Den Mushi and share their knowledge so far. Sanji and his team decide to head back to Dressrosa and Franky asks permission to assist the Riku army&#39;s revolution, to which Luffy urges him to go all out. While Admiral Fujitora arrives at the shores of Dressrosa, there is a big ruckus in the city, with explosions and buildings being cut in half. Doflamingo has Law beaten on the ground, right outside the Colosseum. He, then, takes out a pistol and shoots Law three times.</p>

Seeing that he can no longer fight, Zoro offers his life to save Luffy, saying that he cannot hope to become the world&#39;s best swordsman if he cannot protect his captain. Sanji attempts to take Zoro&#39;s place, but Zoro knocks him out. As part of his agreement with Kuma, Zoro takes in all of Luffy&#39;s pain and fatigue, which Kuma says would kill him if he suffered it on top of his already severe wounds. Zoro takes in the pain, and Kuma leaves, remarking on how Luffy has a loyal crew. Luffy regains consciousness, surprisingly energetic, while Zoro emerges from his sacrifice near death.</p>

Magellan goes on, to the staircase of level 3, only to find the unconscious Hannyabal, who he tells in his mind is his succesor.

Previously roasted celebrities include William Shatner, Flavor Flav, Pamela Anderson, David Hasselhoff and Denis Leary.

The roast consisted of jokes toward Trump&#39;s hairstyle, his show The Apprentice, and his family. Jokes were also made about Jeselnik&#39;s fame (or lack thereof), Matlin&#39;s deafness, King&#39;s age, and Jersey Shore. Several roasters paid respect to Greg Giraldo, a Comedy Central Roast regular, who died on September 29, 2010. Mike &#34;The Situation&#34; Sorrentino was highly criticized for his performance; as a result, Comedy Central pulled several of his jokes from the television airing of the roast.[20] This roast was dedicated in memory of Greg Giraldo. This was also the first time someone served as roastmaster more than once, as Seth MacFarlane also roasted David Hasselhoff.</p>

                </div><p class="episode-quote">The roast was taped in Los Angeles on September 10, 2011, and was broadcast on September 19, 2011, exactly one hour after the premiere of Ashton Kutcher&#39;s first episode of replacing Sheen on Two and a Half Men.[21] Roasters included Mike Tyson, Jeff Ross, Anthony Jeselnik, Steve-O,[22] William Shatner, Kate Walsh, Jon Lovitz, Patrice O&#39;Neal and Amy Schumer. Slash made an appearance playing his guitar during Sheen&#39;s entrance.[23] Harvey Levin from TMZ.com was scheduled to appear but ended up not doing so. During an interview on The View, Sheen&#39;s ex-wife, Denise Richards stated that she hadn&#39;t been invited to appear and, while she thought roasting her ex-husband could be humorous and that he would be able to take it, she feared it would have a negative impact on their daughters.[24] Sheen&#39;s famous family members, Emilio Estevez and Martin Sheen, were unable to attend as they were promoting their film The Way,[25] although Martin appeared in a commercial for the roast, spoofing his film Apocalypse Now. Brooke Mueller, Aaron Paul, Corbin Bernsen, Duane Chapman, Michael Boatman, Kristin Cavallari and Richard Kind appeared in the audience. Seth MacFarlane made his third appearance as the roastmaster. A montage of Sheen&#39;s film and television work were featured, though due to legal reasons, clips of his tenure on Two and a Half Men were never used. In the UK and Turkey, on the network which Two and a Half Men airs, The Roast of Charlie Sheen aired directly after Kutcher&#39;s first Two and a Half Men episode. This was O&#39;Neal&#39;s final television appearance before his death on November 29, 2011.</p>

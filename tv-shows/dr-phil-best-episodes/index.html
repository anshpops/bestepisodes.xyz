Jean says her daughter has become rude, disrespectful, verbally and physically abusive, and she’s worried Cheyenne is throwing away her promising future. Cheyenne says she loves Josh, and no one can keep her from seeing him -- not even her mother. Josh says there’s nothing wrong with his relationship with Cheyenne, and he can’t wait until his fiancée is 18, so they don’t have to deal with Jean anymore. Dr. Phil takes a look at Josh’s history -- should Jean be concerned? And, can this fractured mother-daughter relationship be repaired? This show contains sexual content.

                </div><p class="episode-quote">Jonni’s 23-year-old daughter, Christina Morris, disappeared almost two years ago, after a night out with friends. She was last seen on surveillance video walking into a parking garage with an acquaintance, Enrique Arochi. Just three minutes later, Enrique was seen on that same camera leaving the parking garage alone in his car. Christina has not been seen or heard from since. While Enrique has denied any involvement in Christina’s disappearance, he was arrested in December 2014 and charged with aggravated kidnapping, after authorities say Christina’s DNA was found in the trunk of his car. Jonni says she has become obsessed with finding her daughter, and it’s destroying her marriage. Jonni says she left her husband, Ronnie, behind and moved from Oklahoma to Texas for eight months to search for her daughter. She says her husband realized her only focus is on finding her daughter, not him or her stepchildren. Jonni says she searched every day for 10-12 hours for her daughter and wanted her husband there with her -- but Ronnie says he works 40-60 hours a week and can’t spend all his time trekking through the woods looking for Christina. But Jonni says she will not stop searching until Christina is found. Can Dr. Phil help this couple get their marriage back on track? And, what happened to Christina? Jonni says she has even gotten on her hands and knees and begged Enrique’s father to talk to his son and have him tell her where her daughter is. Plus, an update on the disappearance of Dylan Redwine, who vanished without a trace almost three years ago. The La Plata County Sheriff’s office named a person of interest in August 2015. Find out who that is. His mother, Elaine, gives us an update on the case.</p><div class="episode-ott">

                </div><p class="episode-quote">Kendall claims she was sold by her parents at birth to a powerful international sex trafficker. She says when she wasn’t locked in a cage with other kidnapped children, she was flown all over the world on private planes, being sold to wealthy and powerful men. Kendall says as she grew older, she would often escort these rich and prominent clients to black tie affairs and high profile sporting events. From doctors and politicians to even law enforcement, Kendall says she was taught how to act and dress in order to never raise suspicion. For the first time since she says she left her life of sex trafficking three years ago, Kendall tells her story and explains why she is still petrified that the boss of this operation, whom she calls “the man who owns her,” will find her and bring her back.</p><div class="episode-ott">

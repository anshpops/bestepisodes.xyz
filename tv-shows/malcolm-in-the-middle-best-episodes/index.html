In no time, feminists, conservative religious groups and national new reporters descend on the scene. After Hal grants a TV interview, a woman from his past turns up at the faux protest; and Reese, inspired by the giant billboard stripper who comes to life in his dreams, gives an impassioned speech about the objectification of women.</p>

And there&#39;s more momentous news on the home front: Lois is pregnant. So she pleads with Ida to reconsider her lawsuit: &#34;We&#39;re already stretched to the limit financially as it is. Obviously, a new baby is going to make things even harder on us.&#34; &#34;Yes, yes, of course,&#34; Ida concurs. &#34;You should settle.&#34;</p>

The occasion is a birthday celebration for the old man, but the snooty female in-laws seem more interested in offending Lois. Their shabby behavior initially goes unnoticed by Hal, who&#39;s desperately trying to bond with his self-centered dad; and by Dewey and Reese, who seek some of Grampa&#39;s dough by currying favor with him. But when Lois is reduced to tears after being excluded from a group photo, the family rallies to her side with an all-out counterattack that turns the party into pandemonium.</p>

But after comparing being captured to being grounded, he takes action and leads his team to victory. But being such a successful soldier has it&#39;s bad parts as well, as Reese prepares to jump from the plane - right into Afghanistan. Malcolm has his hands full as well as he attempts to prove Hal innocent. But being good with numbers helps as Malcolm notices all of the prosecutions given dates are on Fridays - which Hal hasn&#39;t worked on in over 15 years. And with Reese missing and Hal&#39;s case, Lois falls deeper and deeper into insanity.</p>

It&#39;s Hal and Lois&#39;s wedding anniversary (hence the dress); and while the boys fend off their mother, with the long-distance assistance of Francis, a lonely and increasingly sozzled Hal bonds with the staff of the restaurant where he booked a table for the big night. Lois finally achieves an epiphany on the phone with Francis, who convinces her to for once &#34;let something go.&#34; After she leaves for the restaurant, with the boys in tow, Hal arrives home to an empty house -- and we learn the truth about what happened to the red dress.</p>

Lois and Hal are forced to ask Ida and Victor to stay longer to help take care of the kids while they work some crazy overtime. Victor treats Reese like a king while Ida tortures Malcolm for being a smart wimp. Victor gives Reese a live grenade, and when Reese inevitably arms it, Malcolm&#39;s quick thinking blows up the new refrigerator instead of the whole house. Hal extorts money out of Lois&#39;s parents to pay for the damage. Francis motivates his fellow cadets to break out for a weekend and go to New Orleans for Mardi Gras, but then spend the entire time there suffering from eating bad sushi.</p>

However, he soon becomes obsessed and spends twenty-four hours a day painting, even stealing money from Francis for more paint. He becomes more and more frustrated until he&#39;s ready to give up, but Lois pushes him and he finishes his masterpiece... only to have the five hundred gallons of paint he slapped up fall down on his head. Francis gets a job over spring break at Lucky Aide, where Lois works, and loses his mind working for Craig in inventory.</p>

                </div><p class="episode-quote">The house goes crazy as Hal is falsely charged in a crime involving his company which he has nothing to do with. He is put in an ankle collar and is immobile, forcing the rest of the family, including Piama and Francis, to pick up the slack. Everyone except Reese, who is missing after he discovers Malcolm with his girlfriend Beth. The family doesn&#39;t know, but Reese has joined the Army, where he doesn&#39;t exactly understand how the military works. Dewey also has his own problems with the family as no one listens or even knows about him leaving for a music competition.</p>

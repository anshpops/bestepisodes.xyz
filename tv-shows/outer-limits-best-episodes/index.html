        <p class="show-quote">The Outer Limits is an anthology series of distinct story episodes, sometimes with a plot twist at the end. Unlike the original incarnation of the series, which was a pure anthology with each episode completely unrelated to the others, the revival series maintained an anthology format, but occasionally featured recurring story elements that were often tied together during season-finale clip shows. The Outer Limits is an American science horror anthology tv-series that was first aired in 1995. See the best episodes of The Outer Limits below.</p>

He and fellow scientist Amanda Harper (Kimberly Huffman) run computer simulations that show the planet&#39;s star will flash over in a matter of days, emitting waves of deadly radiation, so Dr. Chambers urges evacuation. This is not a popular recommendation, especially among the colony&#39;s leaders who include council chairman Franklin Murdock (William Atherton), security head Montgomery Bennett (Alan Scarfe) and Amanda&#39;s father, Ian Harper (Ken Pogue). They point out that Chambers has been wrong before - the colony had to be moved at great cost after he warned of deadly volcanic activity - and suggest that his judgment has been clouded by the death of his wife Elise. When that doesn&#39;t stop Chambers, Murdock and Bennett discredit him by falsely accusing him of being one of the aliens who originally inhabited the planet.</p>

The student, Seth Todtman (Peter Stebbings) claims to have invented a cold-fusion bomb and is threatening to detonate it, killing millions, unless the government brings him five people on a list and kills them for him. Martin&#39;s colleagues dismiss Todtman as a crank, until a sample device he provides goes off with megaton force, wiping out a DOE team and the top-secret facility where they work. Faced with an impossible choice, Martin meets with Todtman face to face and tries to understand the logic behind his rage at the people he wants killed: cruel foster parents, corrupt professors, a heartless librarian. As the clock ticks, Martin tries to reason with Todtman while the military tries to find a way to disarm the device.</p>

It is incapable of emotions - in order to avoid the murderous failures associated with earlier models. But, the new prototype begins showing some disturbing glitches, and escapes during a debugging session, killing a scientist, a security guard and taking Celia (Nana Visitor) hostage. They drive to a deserted warehouse where Celia becomes a reluctant nurse, patching up Mac&#39;s mangled circuitry. Along with instructions for his repairs, Mac transfers visual data on the history of different android projects directly to Celia&#39;s optic nerve. As she becomes more comfortable with her captor, she detects some very human qualities in the motivations behind his flight. As Innobotics&#39; security closes in, Celia tries to convince Mac that the act of rebelling against his creators is emotionally based, and that he does, in fact have feelings.</p>

But when Ship orders him to repair the Artificial Intelligence module Man&#39;s Father (Noah Heney) smashed years earlier in a final, fatal act of defiance, Man learns Ship&#39;s secrets.

Imprisoned inside a large bronze dome, the crew is addressed by The Voice, an unseen Ebonite interrogator, which demands they reveal the secrets of the device. When they resist, The Voice works on them individually in isolation, probing their weaknesses and testing their loyalty to one another. Capt. Kimbro is greeted by an all-to-real replica of a comrade he abandoned to die. Lt. Christopher Valentine (Cameron Graham) is played a fake tape of Kimbro disparaging his ability as a soldier. Dr. Elayna Chomski (Brandy Ledford) doesn&#39;t return from her interrogation at all, and when Maj. Ronald Naguchi (Robin Shou) goes for his, he finds her body dead, ripped open and suspended in liquid. Who will be the first to snap? Kimbro? Valentine? Naguchi?</p>

But, when Dr. Nodel touches a glowing post in the ship&#39;s control room, both he and Paul are consumed by a mysterious light. This leads Hope and the students to believe that they&#39;ve been lead into a trap, a suspicion that is reinforced when the ship captures two of the students and pulls them through the wall. Desperate to find out what&#39;s going on, Hope reads Dr. Nodel&#39;s journal and risks her life by touching the glowing post. Her body begins the same transformation, and a strange glowing entity speaks in the voices of Dr. Nodel and Paul, trying to communicate with her.

After Shal gives birth to a son, the first of the commune to do so, she and the baby are taken away by Mother, a wise alien who acts as a parent to the young people. When the aliens send Shal home without her baby, she asks Brav to help her to rescue the child. With the knowledge Shal has gained from her time with Mother, they break through the protective barrier set up by the aliens to discover a new and fascinating world. It is a dangerous trip, with stinging, snake-like crawlers lurking in the shadows. But, it is also a journey of discovery as Shal and Brav find evidence that lead them to believe that their real parents were killed by the aliens. They find their baby, and after a fight with an alien, escape into the forest.</p>

This is one reason why General James Eiger selected him to spend a year buried in a bunker 11,000 feet below the Artic tundra, manning the controls of a doomsday device set up by world leaders after the Hubble space telescope spotted 11 spaceships heading towards Earth. The device is designed as a last-line deterrent against alien invasion and Conklin&#39;s job, shared with four other loners in four other bunkers, is to hit a dead man&#39;s switch on the bunkers control panel that prevents the doomsday device from going off and destroying aliens and mankind alike. At first, the job is easy, but as the aliens draw closer to Earth, and as Conklin grows closer to his subterranean colleagues, he begins to doubt the reliability of the doomsday machine. News from General Eiger becomes scarce, then Conklin&#39;s fellow guardians begin to fall victim to assorted mishaps. Conklin realizes that he carries the weight of</p>

Initial signs indicate that the planet is both uninhabited and rich in mineral resources, which could mean a million dollar payday for both the crew and the company that owns the Cortez. But on the first exploration, the crew is attacked by gigantic and apparently primitive aliens. After the command falls to Janovitch, she is overpowered by her crew: Sgt. Adam Sears (Jeremy Ratchford), a veteran of pacification missions on Earth, who favors annihilation of the new race and an ambiguous Corporal Charles Pendelton (Tim Guinee). Sears leads a patrol that hunts down and kills the aliens, in the process seizing a golden object that appears to be a religious totem. As he celebrates his slaughter, Janovitch examines his victims and makes a shocking discovery.</p>

At first, Brown tries these individual&#39;s talents out on simple tasks - moving or crushing a granite block with their minds - but soon his true intentions are revealed. Their first real assignment, says Brown, is to use their powers to kill a Balkan terrorist leader and war criminal. Rachel objects to the assignment on moral grounds, but Brown forces her to take part by threatening to send her brother to jail for life.</p>

As part of a top secret program overseen by Dr. Greg Olander (Robert Joy), General Langston Chase (Dale Wilson), and Cotter&#39;s friend, Colonel Pete Butler (Scott Kraft), the contents of McCoy&#39;s brain can be temporarily transferred into an android version of himself. This process creates a virtually indestructible fighting machine with the smarts and experience of a human being. But, one day something goes wrong. During the transfer, the real McCoy&#39;s body is blasted with electricity, stopping his heart, inflicting serious brain damage and leaving Cotter&#39;s mind trapped in the android body. To make matters worse, the interface between his mind and the android body is flawed. McCoy&#39;s motor control is already beginning to break down and the interface will likely collapse within 12 hours.</p>

Both groups mine triradium, a super-powerful radioactive mineral that can be used for both power and illegally for weapons. When a giant explosion appears to consume the Earth and sends a giant shock-wave towards Mars, the soldiers at the Free Alliance base on the Red Planet wonder if the truce has come to an end. Cut off from Earth for 12 hours as Mars rotates, Colonel Samantha Elliot (Barbara Eve Harris) believes someone from the Coalition has been smuggling triradium. With communications temporarily out of order and a Coalition drone approaching the Alliance base, Elliot prepares to launch a preemptive strike. Major James Bowen (Adam Baldwin), who has grown fond of Major Dara Talif (Joan Chen), the Coalition liaison officer at the base, disagrees with Elliot.</p>

He broke the rules and tried out an experimental treatment he had developed with his partner Dr. Don Kingsly (Andrew Airlee). The Cellular Regressor, designed to reverse the effect of age and disease on cells, restored Meredith&#39;s health, but only temporarily. After a few minutes, the cancer returned with a vengeance, killing her instantly. Devastated by Meredith&#39;s death and his research funds cut off, Noah retires at age 35 to a small town, where he moves next door to a couple in their 60s, Barbara (Barbara Rush) and Greg Matheson (Harve Presnell). Noah learns that Barbara gave up a promising career as a jazz singer to marry Greg, a short-tempered traveling salesman who now beats her. Noah&#39;s feelings for Barbara deepen, despite the fact she&#39;s old enough to be his mother. He continues his research on the Cellular Regressor, trying to get it to work.</p>

The tape shows Josh Butler (Alex McArthur), a recluse who lives in a cabin near the park, bringing back to life a young girl who has died after a fall, a feat he accomplishes by generating a mysterious blue glow. But, she only discovers how big a story it is when her pursuit of the strange young man is cut short by a top-secret military unit that is also chasing him. It seems that the blue glow sent out electromagnetic pulses that knocked out two satellites orbiting 20,000 miles above the Earth and the Air Force wants to know what&#39;s going on. A battery of tests doesn&#39;t produce any answers, leaving the brass, lead by Col. Roger Tennent (Scott Hylands) and Major Samuel Harbeck (Larry Musser) to debate whether Butler is an alien or an angel - someone to be dissected or to be worshipped.</p>

It started when he was six, when he set a fire that killed his four-year-old sister and today, at 27, the fear clings to him like a blanket. But, Dr. Adam Pike (Jeffrey Demunn) has hope for a cure. He has diagnosed Bernard&#39;s condition and believes that if he can isolate the part of the brain responsible for fear, the amyglada, he can cure him. The series of injections and radiation designed to build a layer of calcium around the amyglada produces stunning results; Bernard&#39;s fear recedes. He even starts a relationship with his neighbor Lisa (Tanya Allen). But there are side effects. Now, Bernard can use his brain to make others feel the kind of crippling fear he used to feel. He is still a prisoner of the past, haunted by images of Mr. Wilkes (Alex Diakun), the owner of the foster home where Bernard&#39;s sister died.</p>

When Natalie&#39;s husband, Curtis (David Cubitt), touches the cocoon, something amazing happens. He begins to see through the eyes of the creature whose bones were contained in amber, an alien with fearsome claws and teeth. This psychic connection also provides a jolt of energy that liquefies the cocoon and initiates the reconstitution of flesh on the alien&#39;s bones. As the creature begins to come back to life, some of the team, including Emmet Harley (Robert Picardo) want to call in a big corporate lab in order to cash in on their discovery.</p>

The androids are the perfect prey -- strong and intelligent yet unable to turn on their pursuers, thanks to an inhibitor chip that prevents them from harming humans. A group of bow-hunters, George Nichols (Rob White), his son Eric (Tobias Mehler), his older brother Clute (Bob Gunton) and their guide Pete (David McNally), count on that chip as a safety net while they track down a quartet of androids led by Kel (Doug Savant). Eager to provide his brother and his reluctant nephew with a real challenge, Clute has secretly planted information that allows the androids to disable the inhibitor chip thus allowing them to fight back. The machines, angry at being turned into game, contemptuous of human bloodthirstiness, are only too happy to oblige.</p>

Devon&#39;s suspicions are confirmed when he takes a tape of the signal home and his 17 year-old sister, Joyce, and her boyfriend Vic react as if they have heard the most beautiful music in the world. But the sound, which seems comprehensible only to teenagers, has a disturbing side-effect; Joyce and Vic&#39;s skin begins physically changing, as does the skin of all the other teenagers they expose to the sound. Worse, when Devon&#39;s father, Dr. Emory Taylor, orders the &#34;&#34;music&#34;&#34; taken away, the teenagers appear to go through a painful and possibly deadly withdrawal. Faced with the spread of this potentially deadly audio virus, the government imposes martial law as Devon and his father try to figure out why the sound has the effect it does. Is this th</p>

Produced by Jack Parson and hosted by Stan Draper and Heather Cattrell, the show has turned the Justice system on its ear by becoming judge, jury and executioner, allowing a murder victim&#39;s family to carry out the death sentence on live television. Today, Allison Channing will hunt down Declan McMahon, the petty criminal who killed her sister Kaitlin. Declan gets a 20 minute head start, but he&#39;s got a microchip in his brain that&#39;s tuned to the taser that Allison carries. He&#39;s also had a camera implanted in his eye, allowing the home audience to see his point of view as they phone in tips and send digicam images to the studio in exchange for cash rewards. There&#39;s only one problem: Declan insists he was framed, that the security camera footage that would have cleared him has been altered by someone. With Allison on his trail and the ratings going through the roof, Declan turns to his brother Dooley to help him provehis innocence to Allison, his would-be executioner and to the watching world.</p>

After a successful animal test, Nodel secretly tries the formula on himself, with amazing and disturbing results. As his intelligence begins to grow, so do scales on his hands, strange markings on his body, and a mysterious hole in his back. And he seems to be getting instinctive messages telling him to bring &#39;subjects&#39; to a remote wilderness location.

So, his bosses are skeptical when he and scientist Melburn Ross (Michael Shanks) introduce Mary 25 (Sophia Shinas), a nanny robot adapted from the earlier model. In order to overcome their doubts, Charlie proposes letting the robot take care of his own children - a move that is met by serious resistance from his wife Teryl (Cynthia Geary) and his children Brad and Brook. From the beginning, there are problems. Unlike the human nanny, Carmen, Mary doesn&#39;t grasp the subtleties of child care and Melburn must fine tune her. But, Melburn sees that the problems go beyond Mary&#39;s programming.

Lithia is a small agricultural enclave overseen by a group of women that include the regal elder Hera (Julie Harris), Ariel (Claire Rankin), Miranda (Nadia Capone) and Pele (Kirsten Williamson). Mercer&#39;s arrival sparks a debate about the nature of men among some women and revives long-dormant sexual feelings in others. The debate intensifies as Mercer, seeing the enclave&#39;s poverty and primitive tools, begins to repair the community&#39;s broken machines and pushes Miranda, the group&#39;s trade representative to barter with Hyacinth, a neighboring community, for electricity to run the machines. Over the objections of the elders, Mercer gets the machines running.</p>

While investigating further, Perrin discovers a secret that lies behind the locked door in Dr. Givens&#39; office and learns first-hand of the temptations and dangers of undoing the evils of the past.</p>

Her crime - violating severe anti-techology laws passed in the wake of the nuclear holocaust 20 years earlier, an event that destroyed most of the world and prompted those who survived to return to the bucolic world that existed before the Industrial Revolution. Theresa has one last chance for a reprieve. Her lawyer, Nicole Whitely has won leave to appeal to the Supreme Court, a body headed by Chief Justice Haden Wainwright. The balance of the court is divided evenly between conservatives who support the ban on technology and liberals who favor a review. In light of the importance of the case, the government has sent Solicitor General Wallace Gannon, a fierce defender of the law, to argue its case. The court has suspended the normal rules, allowing Theresa to join her lawyer in speaking in her defense.</p>

But, after he&#39;s rescued by a team that includes his fiancee, Kate Girard (Amanda Tapping) and Scott Perkins (Jeffrey Jones), it soon becomes clear that Davidow did not escape unscathed. Removed from the high radiation atmosphere of Venus, his body is reacting to the Earth&#39;s air like that of a chemotherapy patient. When doctors give him the radiation his body seems to crave, strange things start to happen. Davidow&#39;s body begins to spawn duplicate parts - a hand, a torso and more from wounds that miraculously heal. In spite of this, Miles and Kate get married while he&#39;s still in isolation, but his time on Venus and the strange creatures he encountered there have had a profound change on Miles.</p>

Twelve years have passed since a tragedy killed many of their young children and left the residents without hope, without a future. Many of them are still angry with the medical community for not finding a cure to save the children in their small community. The town&#39;s physician, Dr. Malcolm Boussard (Lane Smith) has felt the brunt of their anger - especially since his own two children did not die during the epidemic. Although they were spared, his son Louis (Brad Swaile) still lays in a coma while his daughter Cassie (Rachel Leigh Cook) has learning disabilities and expresses herself through abstract sculpture and artwork. Through hypnosis, Tom begins to probe Cassie&#39;s mind and unravels a memory of &#39;alien&#39; proportions.</p>

Officials on the scene immediately call the Fire Chief and the Fire Marshall because the home presents a huge fire hazard to the neighborhood. Within an hour of being told his girlfriend is dead, the property is crawling with city officials and the house is condemned. Norman is given 30 days to clean up, or he could lose his house forever. Ever since Linda&#39;s husband died ten years ago, she has been adding to a hoard that has now spiraled out of control. Her two grown sons living with her do nothing about it either and each family member blames the other for not cleaning--causing a toxic three-way in the house. If Linda doesn&#39;t get help with the hoarding so she can recuperate and rehab from her future surgery, her sister is threatening to report her to the authorities and will have her own sister &#34;shut-down.&#34;</p><div class="episode-ott">
